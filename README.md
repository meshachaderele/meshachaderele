## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a Data Scientist and PhD Fellow at Land-CRAFT, Aarhus University, Denmark, where I focus on utilizing modern technologies to address pressing environmental challenges. My research primarily revolves around the integration of artificial intelligence into process-based crop models, aiming to reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture in Denmark.
